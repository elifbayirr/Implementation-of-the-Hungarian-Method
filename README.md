it is a method for solving the assignment problem, for example assigning workers to jobs, which goal is to compute the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost, and the like.
"-std=c++11" for this initialization of vector.This is important otherwise it will give an error.

main.cpp must be run along with its other files(Hungarian.h,Hungarian.cpp and Matrix file)

On which matrix you want to work, you must enter the name of that file.(5x5mat,100x100mat etc.)

I keep the result of the outputs in "outputforcpp.txt", you can change it if you want.

If you work on other matrices you can benefit from here

There should be a comma between the lines because that's how it is defined in my code.
